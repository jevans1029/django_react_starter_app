        Hash the user's primary key, email (if available), and some user state
        that's sure to change after a password reset to produce a token that is
        invalidated when it's used:
        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).
        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
           a password reset.
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.
        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking
        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn't compromised.
